Grow wondrous patterns of mushrooms as autumn sweeps the first leaves off the lush trees in the gnome forest.

### _It takes time for life to grow before magic will show itself._

🍄🍄‍🟫🍁🍂


How to play:

watch the gnomes go about their work
plan(t) mushrooms near others by clicking with your mouse
hover and click a fully grown mushroom to pick it
sip on a warm beverage as you admire your (and their) work
gently press escape to start over
